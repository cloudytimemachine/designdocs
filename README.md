# Design Documents

This repository is intended for *Design Documents* (specifications) for features Cloudy Time Machine. Significant features and enhancements **MUST** start with a Design Document.

The goal is to write concise Design Documents that:

* Demonstrate that the requirements are understood
* Communicate to the rest of the team the approach being taken to implement the functionality
* Share knowledge across the team (both current and future) as to **why** certain implementation decisions were made


## Contributing

If you are working on a new feature, simply create a pull request (PR) for your Design Document.

An empty template (`template.md`) can be found in the root directory. The use of this template is **mandatory** as we want consistency in writing and reviewing prior to implementation.
